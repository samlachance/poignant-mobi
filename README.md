### About

I spent a very long time searching for this book in .mobi format with no success so I decided to convert it myself. I used https://github.com/sorah/poignant-guide-epub as my source and converted with Calibre.
Pictures don't work (which is a huge part of this book) and I honestly don't have the time to figure out how to add them on my own.
